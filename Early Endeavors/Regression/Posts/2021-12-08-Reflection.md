##### Introduction
#### In this blog post, I am going to take a holistic review of what I did in my team project for this quarter, the most important things I gained, and what I still need to improve.


##### 1. Overall achievement in your project
In this project, we built a fully functional face mask detector that gives a very high classification accuracy for people of all races. We reached a validation accuracy of more than 95 percent.

##### 2. Two aspects I am proud of
Throughout the course of this project, the thing that makes me proud is how we progress gradually but steadily. We did not expect to get a fully functional model all of an instant, instead we built up our project from making short term and long term goals from the very beginning, to finding the most appropriate data source and technical background information as we expand on it, to finally train our model over and over again to find the best fit. The validation accuracy that stabilizes at around 97 percent was never a lucky lottery, but the summary of our dedicated work in 10 weeks.
For another, with three rounds of presentation and looking at our peers' reviews, I got a clearer idea of how to not only know what I am doing but also present it to the more common audience. Such skills are crucial for future career developments, I believe.

##### 3. Two further improvements and compare to the proposal
The application of static image classification is still limited. As a result, further improvements are needed with the assistance of better hardware for live footage classification. Besides, given an abundance of dataset, it could even improve from classification recognition, pinpointing each indivdual's identity the same time it recognizes whether he's wearing a mask or not.

##### 4. Three things I learned
1. I got a better idea of neural networks. After hands on experience with them, it is no longer an abstract noun for me.
2. Integrated code writing skills. This project enhances my overall ability to check errors and plan the layout of a project more efficiently.
3. Transfer learning. I have learned to implement more useful tools and packages that greatly contribute to my learning and improvement.

##### 5. Significance to my future studies or career
Throughout this project, I reinforced my rigorous scientific attitude, and it further incited my curiousity when exploring new information. I look forward to making complicated diagnosis more efficient, structural planning more optimized, and designing algorithms to complement peopleâ€™s empirical knowledge to make more educated decisions for both sides reciprocally.
