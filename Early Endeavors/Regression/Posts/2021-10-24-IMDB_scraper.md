title: Blog2 - IMDB Scraping

##### Introduction
#### In this project, I am going to implement a cool and effective web scraper that allows me to find the other movies that share the most actors with my own favorite. Here is how I set up the project, allow me to expand on it section by section.


##### PART1: Loading the packages
```python
import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy.http import Request
```

##### PART2: Implementation of the "parse" method
#### The "parse" method recognize the "Cast & Crew" link on the upper right, and yields a request to navigate to the page. Here is the code for this method:

```python
def parse(self, response):
    """
    The "parse" method assumes that I start on the main page of a movie. This 
    is the start of the web-scraping process.
    """
    # Getting the table where the cast link is located
    content = response.css("div.SubNav__SubNavContent-sc-11106ua-3.cKmYsV")
    # Getting the Cast & Crew tab
    cast_tab = content.css("li.ipc-inline-list__item a")[0]
    # Getting the suffix that leads to next page, which is the cast list
    next_page_cast = cast_tab.attrib["href"]
        
    # Go to the next page
    if next_page_cast:
        cast_link = response.urljoin(next_page_cast)
        yield Request(cast_link, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

##### PART3: Implementation of the "parse_full_credits" method
#### The "parse" method pinpoints the link for each actor, this method yields a request to finds the actor's URL that leads to the his or her personal page. Here is the code for this method.
```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    """
    The "parse_full_credits" method is called after the "parse" method. It
    assumes that we have already reached the Cast & Crew page for our movie.
    """
    # Extract the actors selector
    actors_selectors = response.css("table.cast_list tr")[1:]

    for actors in actors_selectors:
        # Check if it is successfully called
        if actors.css("a")[1]:
            actor_page_link = response.urljoin(actors.css("a")[1].css("a").attrib["href"])
            yield Request(actor_page_link, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

##### PART 4: Implementation of the "parse_actor_page" method
#### The "parse" method recognizes the movies and shows that the actor involved in. It creates a dictionary of two elements: the actor's name, and the movies' or shows' names. It also yields the dictionary, which is convenient for me to do further analysis. Here is the code for this section.
```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    """
    Finally, The "parse_actor_page" method is called. Its assumption is that
    we are on the actor's personal page. This is the method whereby we output
    the data we need.
    """
    # Retrieving information about the actor and his or her movies
    movies_selector = response.css("div.filmo-category-section b")
    actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop")[0].css("::text").get()

    for movie_show in movies_selector:
        # Extracting the names and link that
        response.css("h1.header span").css("::text").get()
        movie_show_name = movie_show.css("::text").get()

        if movie_show_name:
            # Writing the
            yield {
                "actor": actor_name,
                "movie": movie_show_name
            }
```

##### PART 5: Data cleaning
#### After I obtained my output, I read the csv file with Jupyter Notebook and did a few data manipulation to find the number of shared actors for each of the movies with my favorite. Here are the results.
```python
import pandas as pd
Actors_Movies = pd.read_csv("output.csv")
Aggregate = Actors_Movies.groupby("movie").aggregate(len)
Aggregate.index.name = 'Movie'
Aggregate.reset_index(inplace=True)
Aggregate = Aggregate.sort_values("actor", ascending = False)
Aggregate.head(30)
```

##### PART6: Recommendation
#### This scraper is really helpful if we want to find the relevant movies based on our favorite actors or actresses. Apart from that, it is very possible to scrape with the release date, countries, and even genre as well. I will be interested in seeing how to implement the techniques I learned into achieving those as well.

##### PART7: Conclusion and appendment
#### In this project, I got familiar with some of the most useful web-scraping techniques. Another valuable thing I achieved is that by using developer tools, I got first-hand experience with the most fundamental data structures in creating a website, which definitely sheds light into my potential future endeavors. That's so much for my project, see you next time!

##### Here is the complete code fot the scraper:
```python
import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy.http import Request

class QuoteSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "imdb_spider"

    start_urls = ["https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/?ref_=tt_ql_cl"]

    
    def parse(self, response):
        # Getting the table where the cast link is located
        content = response.css("div.SubNav__SubNavContent-sc-11106ua-3.cKmYsV").css("li.ipc-inline-list__item a")[0]
        # Getting the suffix that leads to next page, which is the cast list
        next_page_cast = content.attrib["href"]
        
        # Go to the next page
        if next_page_cast:
            cast_link = response.urljoin(next_page_cast)

            yield Request(cast_link, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
            

    def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        # Extract the actors selector
        actors_selectors = response.css("table.cast_list tr")[1:]

        for actors in actors_selectors:

            if actors.css("a")[1]:
                actor_page_link = response.urljoin(actors.css("a")[1].css("a").attrib["href"])

                yield Request(actor_page_link, callback = self.parse_actor_page)

        
    def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        # Retrieving information about the actor and his or her movies on the actors page
        movies_selector = response.css("div.filmo-category-section b")
        actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop")[0].css("::text").get()

        for movie_show in movies_selector:
            # Extracting the names and link that
            response.css("h1.header span").css("::text").get()
            movie_show_name = movie_show.css("::text").get()

            if movie_show_name:

                yield {
                    "actor": actor_name,
                    "movie": movie_show_name
                }
```
