Introduction to Yuchen Zhang's final game

1. INTRO
My game is inspired by two of the most popular PC games ever made -- Plants vs Zombies and Minecraft. The game resembles
PVZ in that the player could hurl projectiles similar to how plants do in PVZ, and the characters and enemies, and the
control of the player, is inspired by Minecraft. The game has three levels, each having its own enemies. There are also
intermediate stages for the player to prepare. The calculation of the final score will be discussed below.

2. Characters
    i.
    The protagonist of the game is you, the player. You must defend the left wall of the screen from the enemies,
    which could be Creepers, Spider Jockeys, or both of them depending on the level you are currently in. You can move
    left or right, and can launch three types of projectiles: bullets, bombs, or ice bombs, each having their own
    characteristics. This will be discussed in detail. You have a health of 5. Whenever a Spider Jockey or Creeper
    makes collision with you before you manage to kill them, your health decrements by 1.
    ii.
    Creepers appear in the first and third level. They can only move horizontally, but with different speeds. They
    appear from right side of the screen. They have a health of 3.
    iii.
    Spider Jockeys appear from the top of the screen and move downwards until they reach the ground, before joining
    the Creepers in their leftward movements. They have different vertical speeds and horizontal speeds. They have a
    health of 5. However, if you hit them during their descend with a bomb or ice bomb, they die instantly. To deal
    with those guys, definitely prioritize using bombs and ice bombs.

3. Scoring System
Creepers and Spider Jockeys award you with different points in different levels, namely, higher points in higher
levels. Each bullet you launch costs 2 points, and each bomb you launch costs 7 points.
For every damage you take, your score decrements by 100.
If you die, your score decrements by 300.
If you manage to kill two different enemies using different projectiles within a time span of 0.2 seconds, it counts
as double kill. The higher the level, the more points you get awarded with each double kill.

4. Control
You can only move in a limited space within the left side of the screen. To go left, press A key; To go right, press
D key; to stop moving, press S key.
To launch bullets, press Space key.
To launch bombs, press Enter key.
To launch ice bombs, press Shift key.

in order to advance. It is up to you to decide when to beat the target and start.
